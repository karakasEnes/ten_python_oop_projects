# What is this project about?

- This project is a back-end (API) project builded with justpy for App 8,
  - Normally App8 gets data using front-end which is not good approach.
  - This is why building (this app 9) will serve as back-end for App 8.

# How it's work?

- download files, install requirements, activate app,
- python main.py
- Open your browser.

  - Make a request to the back-end

    - http://localhost:8005/api?w=moon

  - Receiving data is in json format so our App 8 can get it via request.
