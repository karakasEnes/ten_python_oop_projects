# What is this project about?

- This is CLI based python project.
- It's a calculator about 2 different flatmates, based how many days they stayed in house between period (usually 30days)
- After providing inputs, program gives automatically generated filed inside output folder also it upload that file to cloud (filestack), then it provide the link.

# Notes

- Replit has problem to access env variables, it works fine while developing apps, however when you publish, it doesn't work. Thats why, I'm not uploading generated pdf to cloud. However downloading project locally and running it with your own api_key from filestack will work fine. All you have to do adding .env file to project root then key-value pair in it (Eg: FILESTACK_API_KEY=your_api).
